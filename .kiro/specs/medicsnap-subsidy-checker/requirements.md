# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HealthKaki is a Singapore medical assistant application targeting elderly users who need help understanding their medical bills, subsidy eligibility, and medication labels. The application provides two core features: (1) a Medical Subsidy Checker that allows users to photograph medical documents (receipts, bills, referral letters), extracts structured data via Gemini OCR, automatically detects and redacts NRIC numbers for privacy, looks up applicable government medical subsidies from a Supabase database, and presents results with Text-to-Speech output for accessibility; and (2) a Medication Label Scanner that allows users to photograph medication packaging to understand what their medicine is for and how to take it, in their preferred language. The system is built on Next.js 14 with existing integrations to Google Gemini and Supabase.

4. THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL redact NRIC numbers before any extracted text is displayed to the user in results
5. IF the NRIC_Redactor encounters a partial NRIC pattern (a prefix letter S, T, F, or G followed by between 4 and 6 digits followed by one letter suffix), THEN THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL still redact the partial match to prevent information leakage
6. IF the NRIC_Redactor encounters an error during processing, THEN THE HealthKaki_App SHALL reject the document processing request and return an error rather than risk exposing unredacted NRIC numbers

### Requirement 4: Stateless Document Processing

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want my document photo 
to be processed privately, so that my personal medical 
information is never stored on any server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN no matching subsidy scheme is found, THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL return a message indicating no subsidies were found and suggest the user consult a medical social worker
5. THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL filter subsidy results by the institution type extracted from the document, mapping the institution name to one of the categories: public hospital, polyclinic, or GP clinic
6. IF the subsidy database query fails, THEN THE HealthKaki_App SHALL display a user-friendly error message and suggest the user try again later
7. IF extracted medical data contains no medicalCodes and no diagnoses (both are empty arrays or null), THEN THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL skip the database query and return a message indicating insufficient data was extracted to determine subsidy eligibility

### Requirement 6: Results Presentation

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want the subsidy information presented clearly and simply, so that I can understand what financial help is available to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subsidy results are available, THE HealthKaki_App SHALL display each applicable subsidy scheme as a distinct card with the scheme name and estimated coverage percentage, ordered by estimated coverage percentage from highest to lowest; users MAY open a card to view additional scheme details
