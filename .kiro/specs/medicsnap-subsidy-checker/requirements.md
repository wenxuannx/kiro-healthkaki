# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SubsidyKaki is a Singapore medical subsidy checker application targeting elderly users who need assistance understanding their medical bills and subsidy eligibility. The application allows users to photograph medical documents (receipts, bills, referral letters), extracts structured data via Gemini OCR, automatically detects and redacts NRIC numbers for privacy, looks up applicable government medical subsidies from a Supabase database, and presents results with Text-to-Speech output for accessibility. The system is built on Next.js 14 with existing integrations to Google Gemini and Supabase.

6. THE Document_Capture_Module SHALL display a preview of the captured or uploaded image before submission
7. WHEN the user confirms the document image, THE Document_Capture_Module SHALL display a loading indicator and submit the image to the processing API endpoint
8. IF the submission to the processing API endpoint fails due to a network error or server error, THEN THE Document_Capture_Module SHALL display an error message indicating the submission failed and allow the user to retry without re-uploading the document
9. IF camera access permission is denied by the user or unavailable on the device, THEN THE Document_Capture_Module SHALL disable the camera capture button and display a message directing the user to use the file upload option instead
10. WHEN a PDF file exceeding 5 pages is selected, THE Document_Capture_Module SHALL display an error message indicating the maximum page limit

### Requirement 2: Gemini OCR Document Processing

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want the system to automatically read my medical document, so that I do not need to type in any details manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a medical document image is submitted, THE OCR_Engine SHALL extract medical codes (ICD-10, SNOMED, or local clinic codes) from the document
2. WHEN a medical document image is submitted, THE OCR_Engine SHALL extract diagnosis or condition names from the document
3. WHEN a medical document image is submitted, THE OCR_Engine SHALL extract the date of visit from the document
4. WHEN a medical document image is submitted, THE OCR_Engine SHALL extract the healthcare institution name from the document
5. WHEN a medical document image is submitted, THE OCR_Engine SHALL extract the full text content of the document
6. IF the OCR_Engine extracts none of the structured fields (medicalCodes, diagnoses, visitDate, and institution are all empty or null), THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display an error message indicating the document could not be read and suggesting the user retake the photo with better lighting or angle
7. THE OCR_Engine SHALL return extracted data as a structured JSON object containing medicalCodes (array of strings), diagnoses (array of strings), visitDate (ISO 8601 date string in YYYY-MM-DD format or null), institution (string or null), and rawText (string) fields
8. IF the OCR_Engine determines the submitted image does not contain medical content, THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL inform the user that the image does not appear to be a medical document
9. WHEN a medical document image is submitted, THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL accept only JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, or PDF files with a maximum file size of 10 MB
10. IF the OCR_Engine does not return a result within 30 seconds, THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display an error message indicating the request timed out and suggesting the user try again
11. WHEN the OCR_Engine extracts only a subset of structured fields, THE OCR_Engine SHALL return null or an empty array for any fields that could not be identified, and THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL present the partially extracted data to the user
12. WHEN the OCR_Engine cannot extract birth year OR clinic type with sufficient confidence, THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display a manual fallback form with a birth year dropdown, clinic type selector, and chronic condition checkboxes, and SHALL NOT display a dead-end error screen

### Requirement 3: NRIC Detection and Redaction

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want my NRIC number to be automatically hidden from stored documents, so that my personal identity is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is extracted from a document, THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL detect all NRIC numbers matching the case-insensitive pattern of one letter prefix (S, T, F, or G) followed by seven digits followed by one letter suffix
2. WHEN an NRIC number is detected in extracted text, THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL replace the NRIC number with the placeholder text "[REDACTED]"
3. THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL redact NRIC numbers before any extracted text is stored in the database
4. THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL redact NRIC numbers before any extracted text is displayed to the user in results
5. IF the NRIC_Redactor encounters a partial NRIC pattern (a prefix letter S, T, F, or G followed by between 4 and 6 digits followed by one letter suffix), THEN THE NRIC_Redactor SHALL still redact the partial match to prevent information leakage
6. IF the NRIC_Redactor encounters an error during processing, THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL reject the document processing request and return an error rather than risk exposing unredacted NRIC numbers

### Requirement 4: Stateless Document Processing

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want my document photo 
to be processed privately, so that my personal medical 
information is never stored on any server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL process all uploaded images in server memory only and SHALL NOT write image data to any database or file storage system
2. THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL discard all image binary data immediately after the OCR API response is returned
3. THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL NOT store raw extracted text in any database — only the computed subsidy result may be held temporarily in the API response
4. IF a user closes the app, THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL retain no trace of the uploaded document

### Requirement 5: Subsidy Eligibility Lookup

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want to know which government medical subsidies I may be eligible for based on my medical document, so that I can reduce my out-of-pocket healthcare costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracted medical data is available and contains at least one non-empty medicalCodes entry or one non-empty diagnoses entry, THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL query the Supabase "subsidy_schemes" table for matching subsidy schemes based on medical codes and diagnoses
2. THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL return all applicable Singapore government medical subsidy schemes including Pioneer Generation Package (born before 1950), Merdeka Generation Package (born 1950–1959), CHAS Blue, CHAS Orange, CHAS Green, MediSave CDMP, MediShield Life, and MediFund
3. WHEN a matching subsidy scheme is found, THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL return the scheme name, coverage description, eligibility conditions, and estimated coverage percentage
4. WHEN no matching subsidy scheme is found, THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL return a message indicating no subsidies were found and suggest the user consult a medical social worker
5. THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL filter subsidy results by the institution type extracted from the document, mapping the institution name to one of the categories: public hospital, polyclinic, or GP clinic
6. IF the subsidy database query fails, THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display a user-friendly error message and suggest the user try again later
7. IF extracted medical data contains no medicalCodes and no diagnoses (both are empty arrays or null), THEN THE Subsidy_Lookup_Service SHALL skip the database query and return a message indicating insufficient data was extracted to determine subsidy eligibility

### Requirement 6: Results Presentation

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want the subsidy information presented clearly and simply, so that I can understand what financial help is available to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subsidy results are available, THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display each applicable subsidy scheme as a distinct card with the scheme name, coverage description, and eligibility conditions, ordered by estimated coverage amount from highest to lowest
2. THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL use a minimum font size of 18px for body text and 24px for headings in the results display

5. THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display results in the user's selected language, supporting English (default), Simplified Chinese, Bahasa Melayu, and Tamil, controlled by the same language toggle used by the TTS_Module. WHERE a translation for a subsidy scheme is unavailable in the selected language, THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL fall back to displaying that scheme's card in English.
6. IF no applicable subsidy schemes are found, THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display a message indicating that no matching schemes were identified and suggest the user verify their document or consult a nearby Community Centre for assistance
7. IF a subsidy scheme does not have a translation available in the selected language, THEN THE SubsidyKaki_App SHALL display that scheme's card in English only.

### Requirement 7: Text-to-Speech Accessibility

**User Story:** As an elderly user with limited vision, I want the subsidy results read aloud to me, so that I can understand the information without straining to read the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subsidy results are displayed, THE TTS_Module SHALL provide a "Read Aloud" button with a minimum touch target size of 44×44 CSS pixels, positioned at the top of the results section
2. WHEN the user activates the "Read Aloud" button, THE TTS_Module SHALL read all visible subsidy results text content aloud using the Web Speech API, in top-to-bottom document order
3. THE TTS_Module SHALL use a speaking rate between 0.7x and 0.75x normal speed (inclusive) to accommodate elderly listeners
4. WHILE the TTS_Module is reading aloud, THE TTS_Module SHALL display pause and stop controls with a minimum touch target size of 44×44 CSS pixels each
5. WHILE the TTS_Module is reading aloud, THE TTS_Module SHALL visually highlight the text segment currently being spoken using a background color that meets a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 against surrounding unhighlighted text
6. IF the English (Singapore) voice locale (en-SG) is available on the device, THEN THE TTS_Module SHALL use en-SG as the speech voice locale; otherwise THE TTS_Module SHALL use the device default English locale
7. IF the Web Speech API is not supported by the user's browser, THEN THE TTS_Module SHALL hide the "Read Aloud" button and display no error
8. WHEN the TTS_Module finishes reading all content or the user activates the stop control, THE TTS_Module SHALL remove the text highlight, hide the pause and stop controls, and restore the "Read Aloud" button to its initial state
9. THE TTS_Module SHALL support four language options: English (en-SG), Simplified Chinese (cmn-Hans-CN), Bahasa Melayu (ms-MY), and Tamil (ta-IN), selectable via a language toggle visible on the results screen

### Requirement 8: Loading and Progress Feedback

**User Story:** As an elderly user, I want clear feedback while my document is being processed, so that I know the application is working and I do not need to take any action.
